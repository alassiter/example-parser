Thought Process
- Create a Parser class which is instantiated
  by passing in a text file that needs parsing
- Loop through each line
- if its a header make a new key => {}
- if its a key:value pair, add it to the hash
- if there's a blank at the beginning, add the line to the previous value
- change the value type to either Integer, Float or String
- allow the setting of a value
- write the new settings to a file

TODO:
- build an interface to run from the command line
  - present possible headers
  - once inside a header, present possible keys to get values
  - build up a current_path to know which header we are in

If there's time:
- Create a Section class to encapsulate header > key > value functionality
- Introduce some exception handling if user allowed to input requested header and key
