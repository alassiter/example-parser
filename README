Thought Process
- Create a Parser class which is instantiated
  by passing in a text file that needs parsing
- Loop through each line
- if its a header make a new key => {}
- if its a key:value pair, add it to the hash
- if there's a blank at the beginning, add the line to the previous value

If there's time:
- Create a Section class that has a header and several settings
